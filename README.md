I’m a QA Lead / QA Architect with 10+ years of experience designing test automation architectures, scaling quality engineering teams, and embedding quality across the software delivery lifecycle. I combine hands-on automation and test engineering with strategic leadership to deliver reliable CI/CD-aligned test pipelines and measurable QA outcomes.


---

## What I deliver
- Strategic QA leadership: establish QA roadmaps, standards, and quality metrics.  
- Test automation architecture: build maintainable, scalable frameworks using BDD and modular patterns.  
- End-to-end testing expertise: UI, API, mobile and performance testing across multiple tech stacks.  
- CI/CD & DevOps alignment: integrate tests into pipelines for fast, reliable feedback and gating.  
- Team enablement: hire, mentor, and scale cross-functional QA capability.

## Core skills
- Languages: Java · JavaScript · TypeScript · Python · C# · SQL  
- Automation & Frameworks: Playwright · Cypress · Selenium · Appium · Cucumber (BDD) · TestNG · Mocha  
- CI / Cloud / Tools: GitHub Actions · Jenkins · Docker · Kubernetes · BrowserStack · AWS · Azure  
- API & Performance: Rest Assured · Postman · JMeter · k6  
- Other: QA strategy · Test metrics · Flakiness reduction · AI-assisted testing · Auto-healing automation

##  Projects (high-level)
- [web_automation_BDD](https://github.com/donrifad/web_automation_BDD) — Java-based BDD automation framework for robust web UI testing with modular step design and CI integration.  
- [python-bdd-api-framework](https://github.com/donrifad/python-bdd-api-framework) — Python BDD framework focused on API validation, reusable fixtures, and clear reporting.  
- [cypress_frontend_automation](https://github.com/donrifad/cypress_frontend_automation) — Frontend E2E automation with Cypress, parallel execution, and stable test patterns.  
- [Ensek_API](https://github.com/rifadofuk/Ensek_API.git) — C#-based BDD implementation for API scenarios and integration testing.

(Each project contains readmes with setup, execution patterns, and CI examples. Explore for quick demos of framework patterns and execution flows.)

---

## How I work 
- Prioritize risk: target critical user flows and integration points first.  
- Build modular automation: reusable building blocks, page/interaction abstractions, and stable test data strategies.  
- Integrate early: PR-level checks, pipeline gates, and fast feedback loops.  
- Measure & improve: track flaky tests, coverage, execution time, and release health; iterate to reduce cycle time.  
- Scale teams: hiring, mentorship, and introducing standards to make QA a first-class, measurable discipline.

---

## Achievements & impact
- Designed and delivered enterprise-grade automation frameworks that reduced regression cycle time and improved release confidence.  
- Built QA capability for cross-functional teams, enabling consistent delivery and measurable quality improvements.  
- Led initiatives on AI-assisted test maintenance and auto-healing patterns to reduce test flakiness and maintenance overhead.

---

## What I'm learning
- Quality observability: test metrics, release health indicators, and production-quality signals for dashboards
- Smart contract & blockchain testing fundamentals (API validation, data integrity, and security-focused testing)
- Test strategies for crypto platforms: wallets, transactions, pricing feeds, and backend-for-frontend APIs
- Performance, reliability, and risk-based testing for high-throughput crypto and fintech systems
